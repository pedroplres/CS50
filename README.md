# CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science

## About
This repository documents my progress in the Harvard CS50 course, an introduction to computer science. I am solving the problem sets defined in the course and sharing my solutions here.

## Solved Problems
1. **Hello**: The classic "Hello, World!" in C.
2. **Scrabble**: Determination of the score of a word in the Scrabble game in C.
3. **Cash**: C program to calculate the minimum number of coins needed for change.
4. **Mario-less**: C implementation to generate pyramids as in the Mario game.
5. **Readability**: Calculation of the readability index of a text in C.
6. **Caesar**: Implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm in C.


## Current Progress
Currently, I am working on the course whenever I have free time, and I find the content very interesting. Each solved problem represents a overcome challenge, and I am looking forward to tackling the next ones.

## Contributions
This is a personal project to document my progress, but if you are also taking the same course or have constructive suggestions, feel free to contribute by opening issues or pull requests.

## Acknowledgments
I appreciate the CS50 team for providing such a challenging and engaging course.
